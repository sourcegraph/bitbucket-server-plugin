# Sourcegraph Bitbucket Server Integration

Sourcegraph's Bitbucket Server integration adds code intelligence to Bitbucket Server code views and pull requests.

## Local Development

* `atlas-run`   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* `atlas-debug` -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* `atlas-help`  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
